At the arising of new type of technologies people often give critical thinking about the characteristics of the innovation fact, the acceptance or rejection of this usually depends on the benefit they would receive. We can recall the recent smartphone to illustrate an example of advantage over the previous and classical cellphone because the first one is easy to use, very handable, stylish, slim, with many functionalities in comparison to the first cellphones created at the beginning of century. Once people observe an imporvement, they will associate the innovation with their life compatibility. To have a clear idea of compatibility, the consumer will (consciously or subconsciously) consider many variables, like the simplicity change in usability, when a technology looks hard to use, there is a low probability to be adopted. There are two key concepts to explain this; Trialability which refers to the easiness of the user to experiment with the new innovation, and the Observavility which deals with how visible is the innovation, while more visible the information is, the more drivable the communication is to build formal and personal networks. Social network platoforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn where users create a detailed profile and share personal opinions and information have become the new target to cyber criminals. Besides being the objective of bad people, this sites could compromise the prestige of certain organizations due to employee postings who might share sensitive information.Data management as part of the information and communication technology is a tedious process. Data need to be handle by teamwork organizations which must assume the responsibility of each phase on the data life process, managing data requires specific skills to design plans for systems with high technical administration to generate good quality software and hardware, skills for data analysis is essential to understand problems and overcome issues, analytical skills to interpret data, skill languages to define a great model as well as critical and strategical thinking to identify opportunity areas for serving clients to fulfil respective goals. Some industries have special guidelines for recording, storing, and encrypting data. Delete, change, or distribute to banned locations are also illegal in some cases. Pharmaceuticals, other dangerous chemicals, food, cosmetics, and advanced technology, for example, have restrictions prohibiting the transmission or storage of some data outside of the nation of origin, or requiring data to be encrypted during transfer. When analyzing models, there is an ethical component to Data Science that must be incorporated. Models might produce unexpected outcomes or unintentionally reflect the creators' preconceptions and biases.All artificial intelligence (AI) practitioners should receive ethical training. Every student studying AI, computer science, or data science should, in theory, be taught about ethics and security. Ethics, however, is insufficient. Ethics training can help practitioners understand their duties to all stakeholders, but it must be supplemented with the technical skill to put good intentions into effect by adopting technological measures when a system is being designed and tested. Compliance requirements rise in tandem with data restrictions, frequently in response to data thefts and breaches. Security teams are frequently responsible with overseeing not only IT compliance, but also policies, practices, data classifications, and access authorisation rules throughout the enterprise. Data security, like other areas of data management, should be approached as a corporate initiative. Without a coordinated effort, business divisions will come up with their own security solutions, increasing total costs whilOrganizations might lose money due to breaches and lost productivity if their security architecture or practices are ineffective. These risks can be reduced by implementing an operational security strategy that is properly funded, systems-oriented, and uniform across the organization. The overall process of regulatory statements on security includes identification and classification of sensitive data assets, sensitive data location throughout the enterprise, determination on how each asset needs to be protected and identification of how this information interacts with business processes potentially compromising security owing to inconsistency in protection.

Governments and regulators play a critical role in fostering digital innovation and incentivizing the development of new technologies for societal benefit. By establishing universal standards that represent societal values and preferences, they can promote broad public and consumer interests while also limiting any unanticipated negative implications of these advances. Regulative frameworks, on the other hand, frequently lack the flexibility to keep up with the rapid pace of technological advancements.


QUESTIONS
#########################################################Chapter1############################################################
1. How are Data Management and Professionalism related?
R: The development, execution, and supervision of plans, policies, programs, and practices that deliver, control, protect, and enhance the value of data and information must be performed by any person who works in any facet of data management (from technical management of data throughout its lifecycle to ensuring that data is properly utilized and leveraged) to meet
strategic organizational goals. They  fill numerous roles, from the highly technical (e.g., database administrators, network administrators, programmers) to strategic business (e.g., Data Stewards, Data Strategists, Chief Data Officers).

2. Why might Data and Information be underestimated?
R: Because they are not just assets in the sense that organizations invest in them in order to derive future value. Data and information are also vital to the day-to-day operations of most organizations. They have been called the ‘currency’, the ‘life blood’, and even the ‘new oil’ of the information economy.

3. What are the common data management goals inside an organization?
R: They can include Understanding and supporting the information needs of the enterprise and its stakeholders, including customers, employees, and business partners, capturing, storing, protecting, and ensuring the integrity of data assets, Ensuring the quality of data and information, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of stakeholder data, preventing unauthorized or inappropriate access, manipulation, or use of data information and ensuring data can be used effectively to add value to the enterprise.

4. What are the multiple facets or interpretation society gives to data term?
R: Most people assume that, because data represents facts, it is a form of truth about the world and that the facts will fit together. But ‘facts’ are not always simple or straightforward.Data is a means of representation. It stands for things other than itself. Data is both an interpretation of the objects it represents and an object that must be interpreted (Sebastian-Coleman, 2013). This is another way of saying that we need context for data to be meaningful. Context can be thought of as data’s representational system; such a system includes a common vocabulary and a set of relationships between components. 

5. Why is it important to draw a line between information and data  within an organization?
R: Because of the purposes of clear communication about the requirements and expectations of different uses by different stakeholders. Recognizing data and information need to be prepared for different purposes drives home a central tenet of data management: Both data and information need to be managed. Both will be of higher quality if they are managed together with uses and customer requirements in mind. 

6. What do today's organizations rely on to improve their structure?
R: Today’s organizations rely on their data assets to make more effective decisions and to operate more efficiently. Businesses use data to understand their customers, create new products and services, and improve operational efficiency by cutting costs and controlling risks. Government agencies, educational institutions, and not-for-profit organizations also need high quality data to guide their operational, tactical, and strategic activities. As organizations increasingly depend on data, the value of data assets can be more clearly established.

7. How come change is no longer optional in the pace of business?
R: Digital disruption is the norm. To react to this, business must co-create information solutions with technical data professionals working alongside line-of-business counterparts. They must plan for how to obtain and manage data that they know they need to support business strategy. They must also position themselves to take advantage of opportunities to leverage data in new ways. 

8. How is balance strategic of operational needs achieved?
R: It can best be struck by following a set of principles that recognize salient features of data management and guide data management practice; Data is an asset with unique properties, the value of data can and should be expressed in economic terms, managing data means managing the quality of data, it takes Metadata to manage data, planning to manage data, Data management is cross-functional; it requires a range of skills and expertise, Data management requires an enterprise perspective, Data management must account for a range of perspectives, Data management is lifecycle management, Different types of data have different lifecycle characteristics, Managing data includes managing the risks associated with data, Data management requirements must drive Information Technology decisions, effective data management requires leadership commitment

9. What are the main data management challenges?
R: Differentiation of data from other assets, data valuation, data quality, planning for better data, metadata and data management, cross-functionality of data management, enterprise perspective, accounting for other perspectives, lifecycle of data which inlvolves that the Data Quality must be managed throughout the data lifecycle, Metadata Quality must be managed through the data lifecycle, Data Security must be managed throughout the data lifecycle, Data Management efforts should focus on the most critical data. Following with the challenges there are as well different types of data, risk of data, the compatibility between data management and technology, and finally leadership and commitment.

10. What should a data strategy contain?
R: A data strategy should include business plans to use information to competitive advantage and support enterprise goals. Data strategy must come from an understanding of the data needs inherent in the business strategy: what data the organization needs, how it will get the data, how it will manage it and ensure its reliability over time, and how it will utilize it. Typically, a data strategy requires a supporting Data Management program strategy; a plan for maintaining and improving the quality of data, data integrity, access, and security while mitigating known and implied risks. The strategy must also address known challenges related to data management.

11. How is ethics related to the data management?
Data handling ethics are concerned with how to procure, store, manage, use, and dispose of data in ways that are aligned with ethical principles. Handling data in an ethical manner is necessary to the longterm success of any organization that wants to get value from its data. Unethical data handling can result in the loss of reputation and customers, because it puts at risk people whose data is exposed.

12. How does Ethical data handling affect the trustworthiness of an organization?
 Ethical data handling can increase the trustworthiness of an organization and the organization’s data and process outcomes. This can create better relationships between the organization and its stakeholders. Creating an ethical culture entails introducing proper governance, including institution of controls to ensure that both intended and resulting outcomes of data processing are ethical and do not violate trust or infringe on human dignity. 
 
13. What are the Belmont Principles for medical research applied Information Management disciplines?
R: Respect for persons, which reflects the fundamental ethical requirement that people be treated in a way that respects their dignity and autonomy as human individuals. Beneficence with two elements: first, do not harm; second, maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms and justice that considers the fair and equitable treatment of people.

14. What's the aim of the OECD’s eight core principles?
The Fair Information Processing Standards, are intended to ensure that personal data is processed in a manner that respects individuals’ right to privacy. They include: limitations on data collection; an expectation that data will be of high quality; the requirement that when data is collected, it is done for a specific purpose; limitations on data usage; security safeguards; an expectation of openness and transparency; the right of an individual to challenge the accuracy of data related to himself or herself; and accountability for organizations to follow the guidelines. 

15. What is the purpose of Ownership of data?
The rights to control one’s personal data in relation to social media sites and data brokers. Downstream aggregators of personal data can embed data into deep profiles that individuals are not aware of.

16. What role do Business Intelligence staff play in timing?
Business Intelligence staff may be the first to notice anomalies. In fact, they are now seen as valuable players in the stock trading centers of the world recreating trading patterns looking for such problems as well as analyzing reports and reviewing and monitoring rules and alerts. Ethical Business Intelligence staff may need to alert appropriate governance or management functions to such anomalies. 

17. What is the consecuence of using large data sets in Data Science? 
The use of extremely large data sets in Data Science analyses raises practical rather than merely theoretical concerns about the effectiveness of anonymization. Within large data sets, it is possible to combine data in ways enable individuals to be specifically identified, even if input data sets have been anonymized. The first concern when data lands in a data lake is to analyze it for sensitive data and apply accepted protection methods. 

18. Why may people not the ethical changes?
Because data analytics projects are complex, Organizations need to
actively identify potential risks. They also need to protect whistleblowers who do see risks and raise concerns. Automated monitoring is not sufficient protection from unethical activities. People – the analysts themselves – need to reflect on possible bias. Cultural norms and ethics in the workplace influence corporate behavior – learn and use the ethical risk model. DAMA International encourages data professionals to take a professional stand, and present the risk situation to business leaders who may not have recognized the implications of particular uses of data and these implications in their work.

19. What is the purpose of standards and policies in data governance?
Data Governance must set standards and policies for and provide oversight of data handling practices. Employees must expect fair handling, protection from reporting possible breaches, and noninterference in their personal lives. Data Governance has a particular oversight requirement to review plans and decisions proposed by BI, analytics and Data Science studies.

20. How does Dynamic market affect the condition on the ability to create and share data and information?
Dynamic market conditions and a heightened awareness of data as a competitive differentiator are causing organizations to realign data management responsibilities. This type of change is clear in the financial, ecommerce, government, and retail sectors. Organizations increasingly strive to become data-driven – proactively considering data requirements as part of strategy development, program planning, and technology implementation. 

21. What is the relationship between organizational strategy and DG?
Data governance is not an end in itself. It needs to align directly with organizational strategy. The more clearly it
helps solve organizational problems, the more likely people will change behaviors and adopt governance practices.
Drivers for data governance most often focus on reducing risks or improving processes. 

22. What is the difference between Data Governance and IT governance?
Data governance is separate from IT governance. IT governance makes decisions about IT investments, the IT application portfolio, and the IT project portfolio – in other words, hardware, software, and overall technical architecture. IT governance aligns the IT strategies and investments with enterprise goals and strategies. The COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) framework provides standards for IT governance, but only a small portion of the COBIT framework addresses managing data and information. Some critical topics, such as Sarbanes-Oxley compliance (U.S.A.), span the concerns of corporate governance, IT governance, and data governance. In contrast, Data Governance focuses exclusively on the management of data
assets and of data as an asset.

23. How many principles dos a DG program have and which are? Describe the most important one
It as a total of six principles; Leadership and strategy, Business-driven, Shared responsibility, Multi-layered, Framework-based and Principle-based which is about Guiding principles that are the foundation of DG activities, and especially of DG policy. Often, organizations develop policy without formal principles – they are trying to solve particular problems. Principles can sometimes be reverse-engineered from policy. However, it is best to articulate a core set of principles and best practices as part of policy work.

24. Why should organization adopt Data Governance?
Each organization should adopt a governance model that supports its business strategy and is likely to succeed within its own cultural context. Organizations should also be prepared to evolve that model to meet new challenges. Models differ with respect to their organizational structure, level of formality, and approach to decision-making. Some models are centrally organized, while others are distributed.
